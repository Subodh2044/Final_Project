## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas in python module will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. The Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to create data pipelines and spilt, encoding, tran the model, and prediction will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
The technologies we utilized for the database development and management were AWS for creating the uploading the datasets to S3 and creating the relational database (RDS) in the cloud. We then used Spark for preprocessing (including dropping columns, renaming columns, dropping NAs, and concatenating data sets) and loading the dataset into a provisional database in Postgres using the GUI, pgAdmin4. Finally, we utilized SQL Alchemy to read the Postgres database into Pandas in order to execute machine learning.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the Machine Learning library we'll be using to create a classifier and to train and test setup. We will create the dicision classifier using the Logistic Regression or Decision Tree Model. 
We also combine weak learners using a specific algorithm, like Random Forests, GradientBoostedTree, and XGBoost. After Combining with more decision trees model, then the prediction may be more accurate.

## Dashboard 
We judiciously decided that we will explore and understand Airline Passenger Satisfaction Surevey dataset by analyzing and creating some dashboards in Tableau.
