# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas in python module will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. The Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to create data pipelines and spilt, encoding, tran the model, and prediction will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
The postgres and amazon web service (AWS) will be used for the database, PostgreSQL and pgAdmin will be our gateway into the SQL universe. 
Quick DBD will be used to get a conceptural relational database system (RDS) and SQLAlchemy or  is used to connect to and query a SQLite database

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the Machine Learning library we'll be using to create a classifier and to train and test setup. We will create the dicision classifier using the Logistic Regression or Decision Tree Model. 
We also combine weak learners using a specific algorithm, like Random Forests, GradientBoostedTree, and XGBoost. After Combining with more decision trees model, then the prediction may be more accurate.


## Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on github.io and Tablue public.
